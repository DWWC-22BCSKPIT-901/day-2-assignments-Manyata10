# DAY 2

## Questions :  
• Majority Elements  
Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.  
• Pascal's Triangle
Given an integer numRows, return the first numRows of Pascal's triangle. In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.  
• Remove Linked List Elements  
Given the head of a linked list and an integer val, remove all the nodes of the linked list that has Node.val == val, and return the new head.  
• Baseball Game :  
You are keeping the scores for a baseball game with strange rules. At the beginning of the game, you start with an empty record. You are given a list of strings operations, where operations[i] is the ith operation you must apply to the record and is one of the following:  
An integer x.  
Record a new score of x. '+'.  
Record a new score that is the sum of the previous two scores. 'D'.  
Record a new score that is the double of the previous score. 'C'.  
Invalidate the previous score, removing it from the record.  
Return the sum of all the scores on the record after applying all the operations.   
• You are given an integer array jobs, where jobs[i] is the amount of time it takes to complete the ith job.There are k workers that you canassign jobs to. Each job should be assigned to exactly one worker. The working time of a worker is the sum of the time it takes to complete all jobs assigned to them. Your goal is to devise an optimal assignment such that themaximum working time of any worker is minimized. Return the minimum possible maximum working time.
